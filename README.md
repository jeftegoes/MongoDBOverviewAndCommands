## 1. Whats is MongoDb?

- MongoDB introduces us as an open source, document-oriented NoSQL database designed for ease of development and scaling.
- There are many NoSQL databases on the market today such as Cassandra, BigTable, Dynamo (AWS).

### 1.1. Json format and in collections as documents

- Every record in MongoDB is actually a document. Documents are stored in MongoDB in JSON like Binary JSON (BSN) format.
- BSON documents are objects that contain an ordered list of the elements they store. Each element consists of a domain name and a certain type of value.
- Document based NoSql database
  - It keeps the data structurally in Json format and in documents.
  - Queries can be written in any field or by range.
  - If we compare the structures in MongoDB with the structures in their relational databases, it uses Collection instead of Tables and uses Documents instead of rows.
